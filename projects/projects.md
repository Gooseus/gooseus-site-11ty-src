Here are some things I've (publically) worked on over the years:

- [NimAWS](/projects/nim-aws/) - A [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/){target=_blank} client library for AWS, specifically S3, that was built to upload images from raspberry pi camera kiosks.
- [Hexadecimal Diceware](/projects/hexadecimal-diceware/) - Hexadecimal [diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware){target=_blank} word list/book and passphrase generator.
- [Occam-RA-D3](/projects/occam-ra-d3/) - A simple [D3](https://d3js.org/){target=_blank} pairwise data model explorer based on [Occam DMM](http://dmit.sysc.pdx.edu/){target=_blank} and [Reconstructability Analysis](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022).
- [Reconstructability Analysis with Prime Numbers](/projects/consecutive-prime-number-residue-ra/) - Systems Science graduate school project that was to be my Master's thesis "Reducing Uncertainty in Consecutive Prime Residue Classes with Reconstructability Analysis"&mldr; before COVID.

Many of these are still in progress, and at the very least I'll be adding more information as I dig up more notes and hopefully get some demos working on this site.
