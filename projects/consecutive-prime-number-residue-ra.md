### Reconstructability Analysis with Prime Numbers

This is a project I worked on throughout the two to three years I was studying Systems Science at Portland State University. It was going to be a Master's thesis, but the COVID pandemic made it impossible to continue classes.

I still think about returning to work on it occasionally my old advisor will ask if I'm still interested in finishing it.
