### STAPI TS

This Typescript client library for the [Star Trek API](https://stapi.co){target=_blank} is my only published NPM library [stapi-client-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stapi-client-ts){target=_blank}.

I was tasked with building an integration for this API as part of a coding challenge for a job interview, I didn't do too well in the constrained time limit, but I got enough of roll that I decided to keep going and see what I could do with a mini-hackathon.

I ended up with enough of a working library that I decided to publish it to NPM since there wasn't an JS/TS client library for this API on NPM yet.
