### Website
This site was built with the [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) static site generator using [EJS](https://github.com/mde/ejs) templates and Markdown page content. It uses [ArrowJS](https://www.arrow-js.com/){target=_blank} for simple reactive templates and [Robot](https://thisrobot.life/){target=_blank} finite state machines to control the command console (Backtick [`] key).

Things I like about my site:
- It's very bare-bones and minimalist, so far every page comes in at less than 100kb, including all the Javascript and CSS for the command console and other features.
- The command console (opened with the backtick [`] key) is a fun way to interact with the site which has me thinking of a bunch of other things to build in.
