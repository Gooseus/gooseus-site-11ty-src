Built with [11ty v3](https://11ty.dev) static site generator, emphasizing simplicity and performance. The site uses EJS templates for layouts, Markdown for content, and Rollup for JavaScript bundling.

Design principles:
- **Minimalist** - Every page under 100kb total (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Fast** - Static generation, no runtime frameworks
- **Accessible** - Semantic HTML, readable fonts, clear structure
- **Open** - Source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gooseus/gooseus-site-11ty-src)
