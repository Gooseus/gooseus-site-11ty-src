### ArrowJS

[ArrowJS](https://www.arrow-js.com/){target=_blank} is a simple reactive template library in Typescript. It is a small (~2kb minified) library that allows you to create reactive templates using only a few simple functions and some modern Javascript capabilities. Similar to ReactJS and Lit, but with zero dependencies, a much smaller footprint, and faster.
