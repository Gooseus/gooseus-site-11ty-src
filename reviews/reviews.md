I read a decent bit both online and off; here are some things I've read some things I have to say about them.

### Code
- [ArrowJS](/reviews/arrow-js/)
- [Robot](/reviews/robot3/)
{.main-list}

### Books

I have a lot of physical books that I treasure with many books sorely in need of re-reading, though the vast majority remain only partially read or barely opened. My hope is to that by writing reviews of the books as I read will help with motivation and retention, as well as serve as notes for future review.

Here are a handful of books I'd like to review here:

##### Started
- The End of Uncertainty - Ilya Prigogine
- Why Nations Fail - Daron Acemoglu & James Robinson
- Elements and Relations - Martin Zwick
{.main-list}

##### To Read
- Skin in the Game - Nassim Taleb
- The Nature of Computation - Moore & Mertens
- Godel, Escher, Bach - Douglas Hofstadter
